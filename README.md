# Introduction
My name is Gertin Pakkonen and I am studing IT in Tallinn University. I am trying to make [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) website. I am using Bootstrap 4 framework. 

# Installation
You have to download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to your computer. After Node installation you have to download content from here. If the content is downloaded you have to open that folder with *Terminal/Powershell* and type: 

`npm install bootstrap`

After it is installed you must have now *node_modules* folder. If that is done, the installation is finished.

If you have any trouble you can check solution from [Bootstrap 4 Official page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/).

I will update the manual.
# Update
You can normally update HTML and JS. If you wan't to edit CSS, you have to open *Terminal/Powershell*, open your website folder. Then you have to enter two commands:

`sass custom-css/custom.scss css/style.css`

`sass --watch custom-css/custom.scss:css/style.css`

After that you can make changes in *custom-css/custom.scss* and your system will automatically update your style.css. If you have any problem with SASS command, you can get help from [here](https://sass-lang.com/install)
